### **1. Arrays & Lists Game: "Guess the Number"**
#### **Real-World Scenario**: A simple game where students have to guess a number in a list, simulating how arrays can store a collection of values.

```python
import random

def guess_the_number_game():
    print("Welcome to 'Guess the Number' Game!")
    numbers = random.sample(range(1, 101), 10)  # List of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
    print("I have a list of 10 numbers.")
    
    print("Try to guess the number from the list!")
    
    attempts = 0
    while True:
        guess = int(input(f"Enter a number between 1 and 100: "))
        attempts += 1
        if guess in numbers:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")
            break
        else:
            print("Sorry, that number is not in the list. Try again!")

# Run the game
guess_the_number_game()
```
- **Real-World Connection**: The list of numbers can be imagined as items in a collection, and students have to search for a specific number in that collection.

### **2. Stacks & Queues Game: "Order Your Pizza"**
#### **Real-World Scenario**: A queue simulates how orders are processed in a food delivery system. A stack simulates a "undo" action in a restaurant (like undoing the last order).

```python
from collections import deque

def pizza_order_game():
    print("Welcome to 'Order Your Pizza' Game!")
    order_queue = deque()  # Queue for customer orders
    stack = []  # Stack to undo last order
    
    while True:
        action = input("Enter 'order' to add a pizza to your order, 'undo' to cancel last order, 'show' to view orders, or 'exit' to quit: ").lower()

        if action == "order":
            pizza = input("Enter the pizza name you want to order: ")
            order_queue.append(pizza)
            stack.append(pizza)  # Add to stack for undo functionality
            print(f"Added {pizza} to your order.")
        
        elif action == "undo":
            if stack:
                cancelled_order = stack.pop()
                order_queue.remove(cancelled_order)
                print(f"Cancelled the order: {cancelled_order}.")
            else:
                print("No order to undo.")
        
        elif action == "show":
            if order_queue:
                print("Current orders:")
                for pizza in order_queue:
                    print(pizza)
            else:
                print("No orders yet.")
        
        elif action == "exit":
            print("Exiting the game. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid command.")

# Run the game
pizza_order_game()
```
- **Real-World Connection**: The queue simulates customer orders in the restaurant, and the stack allows for undoing the last action (like canceling an order).

### **3. Linked Lists Game: "Music Playlist"**
#### **Real-World Scenario**: Simulate a music playlist where songs are added dynamically. This game uses a linked list to represent the playlist.

```python
class SongNode:
    def __init__(self, song):
        self.song = song
        self.next = None

class Playlist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
    
    def add_song(self, song):
        new_song = SongNode(song)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_song
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_song

    def remove_song(self, song):
        current = self.head
        previous = None
        while current:
            if current.song == song:
                if previous:
                    previous.next = current.next
                else:
                    self.head = current.next
                print(f"Removed {song} from the playlist.")
                return
            previous = current
            current = current.next
        print(f"{song} not found in the playlist.")

    def show_playlist(self):
        current = self.head
        if not current:
            print("Playlist is empty.")
        else:
            print("Your Playlist:")
            while current:
                print(f"- {current.song}")
                current = current.next

def playlist_game():
    print("Welcome to the 'Music Playlist' Game!")
    playlist = Playlist()
    
    while True:
        action = input("Enter 'add', 'remove', 'show', or 'exit': ").lower()
        if action == 'add':
            song = input("Enter the song you want to add: ")
            playlist.add_song(song)
        elif action == 'remove':
            song = input("Enter the song you want to remove: ")
            playlist.remove_song(song)
        elif action == 'show':
            playlist.show_playlist()
        elif action == 'exit':
            print("Exiting the game. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input.")

# Run the game
playlist_game()
```
- **Real-World Connection**: The linked list represents songs in a playlist, and students can dynamically add or remove songs. This also demonstrates how nodes in a linked list work (each node represents a song).

---

### **4. Recursion Game: "Factorial Finder"**
#### **Real-World Scenario**: Use recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. This can be compared to solving a task step by step (breaking it down recursively).

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

def factorial_game():
    print("Welcome to the 'Factorial Finder' Game!")
    while True:
        try:
            num = int(input("Enter a number to find its factorial (or type 'exit' to quit): "))
            if num < 0:
                print("Please enter a non-negative number.")
            else:
                print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
            break

# Run the game
factorial_game()
```
- **Real-World Connection**: This game demonstrates how recursion works by repeatedly breaking down the problem of calculating a factorial into smaller parts.

---

### **5. Sorting Algorithms Game: "Sort the Cards"**
#### **Real-World Scenario**: This game is based on sorting a deck of cards in increasing order using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. It’s simple and interactive.

```python
def bubble_sort(cards):
    n = len(cards)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if cards[j] > cards[j+1]:
                cards[j], cards[j+1] = cards[j+1], cards[j]  # Swap cards
    return cards

def sort_the_cards_game():
    print("Welcome to the 'Sort the Cards' Game!")
    cards = random.sample(range(1, 101), 10)  # Generate 10 random cards
    print(f"Your unsorted cards: {cards}")
    
    action = input("Would you like to sort the cards? Type 'yes' to sort or 'exit' to quit: ").lower()
    
    if action == 'yes':
        sorted_cards = bubble_sort(cards)
        print(f"Sorted cards: {sorted_cards}")
    elif action == 'exit':
        print("Exiting the game. Goodbye!")
    else:
        print("Invalid command.")

# Run the game
sort_the_cards_game()
```
- **Real-World Connection**: Sorting the cards is a good analogy for **bubble sort**, which repeatedly compares adjacent items and swaps them until everything is sorted.

---

### **6. Searching Algorithms Game: "Find the Hidden Number"**
#### **Real-World Scenario**: You’ll search for a hidden number in an unsorted or sorted list. This is a simple number guessing game.

```python
import random

def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return i  # Return index if found
    return -1  # If target is not found

def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

def search_game():
    print("Welcome to the 'Find the Hidden Number' Game!")
    arr = random.sample(range(1, 101), 10)  # 10 random numbers
    hidden_number = random.choice(arr)  # Select one number to hide
    print("A hidden number has been chosen.")
    
    search_type = input("Do you want to use 'linear search' or 'binary search' (for sorted list)? ").lower()

    if search_type == 'linear search':
        index = linear_search(arr, hidden_number)
    elif search_type == 'binary search':
        arr.sort()  # Sort array for binary search
        index = binary_search(arr, hidden_number)
    else:
        print("Invalid choice.")
        return

    if index != -1:
        print(f"Congratulations! You found the hidden number {hidden_number} at index {index}.")
    else:
        print(f"Oops! The hidden number {hidden_number} was not found.")

# Run the game
search_game()
```
- **Real-World Connection**: The game simulates a simple **search** in an unsorted or sorted list, demonstrating how linear search and binary search work.

    attempts = 0
    while True:
        guess = int(input(f"Enter a number between 1 and 100: "))
        attempts += 1
        if guess in numbers:
            print(f"Congratulations! You found the number in {attempts} attempts.")

            else:
                print("No order to undo.")
        
        elif action == "show":
            if order_queue:
                print("Current orders:")
                for pizza in order_queue:
                    print(pizza)
            else:
